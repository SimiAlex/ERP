ERP practice
ERP software allows business organizations to streamline and consolidate their communications and data, in such a way that the business entity can perform as an integrated organism. 
In some ways, ERP software is similar to a human brain â€“ acting as a collector of information that helps all parts of a company communicate for maximum efficiency.
